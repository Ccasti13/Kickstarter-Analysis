# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns


	Louise Playwright is a client that requested a deep analysis 
	of entertainment crowdfunding data to help her own future campaign. 
	Louise requested over 4,000 different data points to be analyzed, 
	and for the team to create visualizers of the factors that make or break
	a crowdfunding campaign. Factors include launch date, 
	deadlines, country, spotlights, categories, and subcategories.
